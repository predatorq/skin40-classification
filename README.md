Final experiment of ANN2022 class in SYSU.

We built a neural network framework to solve the classification problem of Skin40 dataset. We try various neural network architectures, including CNN-based and Transformer-based networks, including AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, DenseNet, and RepLKNet, Transformer-based neural networks include Swin transformer, ViT, and for Swin transformer we test four different sizes of network data. In addition, because of the small amount of data in this dataset, we try various data augmentation methods and improve the accuracy of the experiments by adjusting the parameters. We try the transfer learning technique, first using the Dermnet and HAM10000 datasets on Kaggle for training and then fine-tuning it with the Skin40 dataset. We try data distillation to train the transformer model, and improve the accuracy of the vision-transformer model. Our model finally achieves 83.625% accuracy in the Skin40 data.

The detailed information is in the **report.pdf**. It is using the IEEE Template, generated by Latex.
